A very bare bones colour picker created in Python using Tkinter and Pyperclip. 
I will be adding more features, functionality and a better looking GUI in the next few weeks/months to come.
Apologies to any and all North Americans confused by the usage of "colour" as opposed to "color" in variable and function names.
